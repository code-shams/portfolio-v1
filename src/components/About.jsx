                    ðŸ”¥ Currently, I'm engaged in MERN stack development -
                    exploring frontend technologies such as React, modern
                    component libraries, and UI/UX best practices, while also
                    diving into backend development, database design, and web
                    security. Thus, preparing myself to be a well-rounded
                    full-stack developer.

                    <br />
                    ðŸš€ Future Plans: I plan to deepen my expertise in React and
                    Node.js, followed by exploring advanced technologies like
                    Next.js and TypeScript. Additionally, I aim to expand my
                    understanding of backend tools such as Docker, WebSockets,
                    and cloud services.

                    ðŸ“š Fun Fact: When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m usually deep into a
                    manga or book. Some day, I'd love to dive into Arduino
                    projects and build something fun.
